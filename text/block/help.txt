This is the help text. As of now, it doesn't have any useful information. It
should contain something along the lines of:

- Controls
- Interface, if this gets ncurses
- What stuff means
- How to use the in-game mechanisms

As of now, this is a standard text block, 80-columns wide, standard for console
printing. Maybe it'll get another format.
